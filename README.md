# Project: Recipes

### Objective/s
This project aims to refresh and test my knowledge on HTML that I have acquired throughout the Odin Project's **[Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)**.

Additionally, this is a good opportunity to practice proper version control with git and in composing good commit messages.

### Lesson/s Learned
- The terminal is your friend. Get consistent practice on it.
- Get familiar with your code editor. Shortcuts helps a lot in saving time.
- Programming/Coding is more than algorithms and syntax. You should consider concepts such as version control, code structure, and matters involving industry standards/practice.

### Things to Improve Upon
- Make a brief plan before starting out to avoid unnecessary commits.
- Commit messages need more work, especially on making it more descriptive. I have to read more examples.
- Still not sure when to commit. I should refresh myself on Atomic Commits and similar guides.
