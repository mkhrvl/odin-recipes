# Project: Recipes

### Objective/s
This project aims to refresh and test my knowledge on HTML that I have acquired throughout the Odin Project's **[Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)**.

Additionally, this is a good opportunity to practice proper version control with git and in composing good commit messages.
